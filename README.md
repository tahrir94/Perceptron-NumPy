# Perceptron-NumPy
This project implements a perceptron classifier using numpy to separate randomly generated data that can be binary classified. The perceptron class which is imported in "Project_2.ipynb" is defined in "perceptron.ipynb". The following tasks are perfrormed in "Project_2":
1) Generate 100 samples in the area of 3𝑥1 + 4x2 - 10 > 0 as positive samples (Label 𝑦 = +1). Generate 100 samples in the area of 3𝑥1 + 4𝑥2 - 10 < 0 as negative samples (Label 𝑦 = -1).
2) Implement the perceptron learning algorithm.
3) Plot the perceptron line w^(T)x = 0 over the data on four subplots: the initial perceptron line, two intermediate states and the final state.
